        <h1>Ethical Hacking Introduction</h1>
        <p>Ethical hacking, also known as white-hat hacking, is a practice of intentionally attempting to penetrate a computer system or network to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers have permission from the system owners to conduct their activities with the goal of improving security.</p>
        <p>Ethical hackers use various techniques and tools to simulate real-world attacks and assess the system's resilience. This information is then used to strengthen security measures and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>Some common areas of ethical hacking include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network penetration testing</li>
            <li>Web application security testing</li>
            <li>Social engineering assessments</li>
            <li>Wireless network auditing</li>
        </ul>
